# Abeebus Results Parser

## abeebus_results_parser.py

I created this parser to support the Abeebus tool for resolving large quantities of IP addresses

Abeebus as a fantasic DFIR resource I have used many times in the course of an investigation but have found that I can sometimes hit an error when trying to write the results to a csv file so built this simply to support that functionality of the tool. All the hard work has been done by Richard Davies
